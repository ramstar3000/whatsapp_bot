##What we built
Our system comprises a robust backend powered by Python, hosted as a Linux bot, and a user-friendly frontend developed using Flask. The backend seamlessly interacts with GreenAPI through HTTP requests to access my phone number. Leveraging the language prowess of GPT 3.5 Turbo, our system excels in multiple aspects:

1. Optimal Reminder Times: GPT predicts the ideal times for sending reminders, eliminating the need for manual selection and ensuring maximum effectiveness.

2. Engaging WhatsApp Prompts: The language model generates captivating WhatsApp messages with just minimal event details. For example, from basic information about the event location and name, GPT crafts engaging prompts like:

``` Reminder: Get ready for Cricket Practice at Fenners in just 30 minutes! Remember to bring your A-game and your sense of humor. As a bonus joke for motivation: Why did the cricket team go to the bank? To get their bowlers back! üòâüèè #GameOn #CricketTime ```

3. User Input Sanitization: GPT assists in sanitizing user inputs to ensure smooth server functionality. We restrict occurrence frequency inputs to a finite set, predicting values from other cases to enhance user experience.

Challenges we ran into

While implementing our solution, we encountered challenges due to token restrictions, leading us to opt for GPT 3.5 Turbo. However, we envision future enhancements by transitioning to GPT 4 and exploring the incorporation of DALL-E for advanced imaging capabilities.

Additionally, we had the issue of time management which I think was overcome by having to remove some features such as posting the website online for public access.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our system has already been successfully deployed on pythonanywhere.com and is actively serving its purpose within my cricket group chat for events starting on Mondays.
